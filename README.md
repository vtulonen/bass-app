# My first react app

# Plan

Goal for the project was to get to know react and create a distraction free way to browse bass related videos from youtube

# !!
Project APIs are no longer valid due to security reasons so the project can't be tested without changing the api confifuration for your self.

# Uses Youtube Data API to fetch videos and playlists of Bassist youtubers

## Channels page

Select a youtuber to view general data about the channel
Press view latest videos to display the videos
Press view playlist to display all playlists the channel has
Press visit channel to go visit in youtube
Choosing a playlist opens a -latest videos like- page where you can view videos of your choice

## Video of the Day

Searches yotube with bass guitar related keywords and returns the latest upload to be watched in an iframe

## Login page 
### FirebaseUI Auth
Tested out firebase authentication to require login to be able to use navigation.

# Final thoughts

With little to no prior experience with react this turned out to be quite a lot of work, but regardless I did learn a lot. This lacks a backend that final idea should absolutely have and the firebase addition didn't help that much with learning react. After learning the fundamentals better, I plan to update or recreate this app with authenticating users with youtube accounts to be able create a custom playlist and also adding a backend better work with the api calls.

# Getting Started with Create React App
